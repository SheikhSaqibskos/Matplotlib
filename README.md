Assignment No: 6 – Matplotlib

Prepared By: Sheikh Saqib

Introduction

This repository contains a comprehensive summary and tutorial on Matplotlib, a popular data visualization library in Python. The script demonstrates various plotting techniques, including line plots, scatter plots, bar charts, histograms, subplots, and customizations such as styles, annotations, and axis controls.

Contents

Basic Line Plot

Sine & Cosine Waves Plot

Custom Line Styles, Colors, and Markers

Scatter Plot

Bar Chart

Histogram

Subplots (Multiple Charts in One Figure)

Axis Limits

Annotations (Adding Text & Arrows)

Styles (Themes)

The provided code includes visual examples of each plot type, along with explanations on how to modify their appearance and behavior.

Getting Started
Prerequisites

To run the provided script, ensure you have Python installed with the following dependencies:

Matplotlib: pip install matplotlib

NumPy: pip install numpy

Running the Code

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/SheikhSaqibskos/Matplotlib


Run the Python script:

python matplotlib_summary.py


The script will generate various plots showing examples of different chart types and customizations.

Detailed Explanation

The script demonstrates the following plotting techniques:

Basic Line Plot
A simple line plot showing how to plot X and Y values.

Sine & Cosine Waves
Visualizing sine and cosine waves using np.linspace to generate smooth values.

Custom Line Styles
How to customize line styles, colors, and markers in plots for better visual appeal.

Scatter Plot
Creating scatter plots with different markers and customizing their appearance.

Bar Chart
Demonstrating how to plot a bar chart with categorical data.

Histogram
Plotting a histogram to visualize the distribution of random data points.

Subplots
How to place multiple plots within the same figure using subplots.

Axis Limits
Modifying axis limits to zoom into specific regions of the plot.

Annotations
Adding annotations, including text and arrows, to highlight points on a plot.

Styles (Themes)
Applying pre-defined Matplotlib styles (such as ggplot) to change the look of your plots.

Example Output

The following are examples of plots you will see when running the script:

Basic Line Plot


Sine & Cosine Waves


Custom Line Styles


Scatter Plot


Bar Chart


Histogram


Subplots


Axis Limits


Annotations


Styled Chart using ggplot
